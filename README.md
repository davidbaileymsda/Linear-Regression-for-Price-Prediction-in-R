# Capstone-Project

For your capstone you will identify an original real-data research question and propose a project to address it. In later tasks you will be asked to gather, analyze, and present data related to your research question.

Create a report (suggested length of approximately 15–20 written pages) by doing the following:

A.  Research Question
Summarize the original real-data research question you identified in task 1. Your summary should include justification for the research question you identified in task 1, a description of the context in which the research question exists, and a discussion of your hypothesis.
 
B.  Data Collection
Report on your data-collection process by describing the relevant data you collected, discussing any advantages and disadvantages of the data-gathering methodology you used, and discussing how you overcame any challenges you encountered during the process of collecting your data.
 
C.  Data Extraction and Preparation
Describe your data-extraction and -preparation process and provide screenshots to illustrate each step. Explain the tools and techniques you used for data extraction and data preparation, including how these tools and techniques were used on the data. Justify why you used these particular tools and techniques, including any advantages or disadvantages of these when used with your data-extraction and -preparation methods.
 
D.  Analysis
Report on your data-analysis process by describing the analysis technique(s) you used to appropriately analyze the data and by justifying the tools used in your data analysis. Include the calculations you performed and their outputs. Justify how you selected the analysis technique(s) you used, including any advantages or disadvantages of these technique(s).
 
E.  Data Summary and Implications
Summarize the implications of your data analysis by discussing the results of your data analysis in the context of the research question, including any limitations of your analysis. Within the context of your research question, recommend a course of action based on your results. Then propose two directions or approaches for future study of the data set.
 
F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

In the professional field, you will often be asked to present complex data and findings to your data analytics peers as well as to people who have little or no experience with data mining and analytics. You will need to demonstrate effective communication skills to present your findings to different audiences.

For this task, you will create an executive summary of your findings from task 2 and then use Panopto to record yourself delivering a presentation of that summary. Your presentation will also include slides displayed by a multimedia tool (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi). This presentation will reiterate, in laymen’s terms, your findings from task 2.

A.  Executive Summary and Implications
Develop an executive summary using your data and results from task 2. The summary should be written for an audience of your data-analytics peers or members of your team and should include each of the following:
 
•  a statement of the problem and the hypothesis
•  a summary of the data-analysis process
•  an outline of the findings
•  an explanation of the limitations of the techniques and tools used
•  a summary of proposed actions
•  expected benefits of the study (be as specific and quantitative as possible)
 
B.  Presentation of Findings

1.  Present your executive summary from part A to an audience of nonpractitioners. Use Panopto to record yourself delivering a presentation that includes slides displayed by a multimedia tool (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi). Your recording should capture both you and your multimedia presentation. Your presentation should also demonstrate appropriate communication skills for the audience.

2.  Your presentation should cover each of the following points:
 
•  a brief introduction of yourself and your background
•  a statement of the problem and the hypothesis
•  a summary of the data-analysis process
•  an outline of the findings
•  an explanation of the limitations of the techniques and tools used
•  a summary of proposed actions
•  expected benefits of the study (be as specific and quantitative as possible)
 
C.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
